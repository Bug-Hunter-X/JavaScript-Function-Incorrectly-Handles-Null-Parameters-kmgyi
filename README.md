This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values in function parameters. The `foo` function in `bug.js` silently returns 0 when either parameter is null, which may lead to unexpected behavior. The corrected version in `bugSolution.js` handles nulls more appropriately by throwing an error, making the function's behavior more predictable and easier to debug.
